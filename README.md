- ## Manage Governance via Azure Policy

  In response to the rapid expansion of organization’s cloud footprint and the discovery of numerous untagged resources during an audit, this project aims to enhance the management and governance of Azure resources. The key objectives include:

  - **Applying resource tags** to attach essential metadata such as owner, project, and cost center to Azure resources.
  - **Enforcing the use of resource tags** for all new resources through Azure Policy.
  - **Updating existing resources** with appropriate resource tags.
  - **Implementing resource locks** to safeguard critical resources from accidental modifications or deletions.

  This project ensures better resource organization, cost management, and compliance with organizational standards. I overcamed challenges such as identifying untagged resources, ensuring Azure Policy enforcement without disrupting workflows, retagging existing resources without downtime, and balancing     resource locks with management flexibility by following the above-mentioned key objectives. 📈🔒

- ## Manage Subscriptions and RBAC

  In this project, I focused on managing Azure subscriptions and implementing Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to enhance security and efficiency. The key tasks included:

  - **Implement Management Groups** 🗂️: Organized and managed multiple subscriptions by setting up management groups.
  - **Review and Assign Built-in Roles** 🔍: Ensured appropriate access by reviewing and assigning a built-in Azure role.
  - **Create Custom RBAC Roles** 🛠️: Tailored access control by creating a custom RBAC role to meet specific needs.
  - **Monitor Role Assignments with Activity Log** 📊: Tracked changes and maintained security by monitoring role assignments using the Activity Log.

  This project demonstrated the effective management of Azure resources through strategic subscription organization and precise access control. By leveraging Azure’s RBAC features, the project ensures that resources are both secure and efficiently managed.

- ## Manage Microsoft Entra ID Identities

  In this project, I delved into the fundamentals of users and groups, which are crucial for building a secure and efficient identity solution. The key tasks included:

  - **Create and Configure User Accounts** 🖥️: Set up and managed user accounts to ensure proper access and security.
  - **Create Groups and Add Members** 👥: Organized users by creating groups and adding members to streamline management and access control.

  This project demonstrates my ability to effectively utilize Azure services to build and manage secure, scalable cloud environments.
